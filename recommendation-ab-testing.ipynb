    "A new feature is being tested on a website, and the company wants to understand the downstream effects on revenue due to this feature addition. This feature corresponds to a new offering to customers/users, that the company doesn't want to offer yet. Hence a direct A/B test would not work. This notebook looks at libraries DoWhy and EconML to build a causal model and understand this area better. "

    "Conducting a straightforward A/B test is impractical as the website lacks the capability to compel users into membership. Similarly, the travel company cannot directly analyze existing data by contrasting members and non-members, since those who opt for membership are probably already more actively involved compared to other users."

    "The solution presents itself through an earlier experiment by the company: Previously, the company had conducted a trial to assess the efficacy of a quicker registration procedure. This experimental nudge towards membership can be used to generate random variation in the likelihood of membership, using a particular class of estimators called Instrument Variable (IV) estimators. IV estimators work by assigning causal relationships to the independent variable using 'a proxy', or an instrument variable. This nudge is called an $intent-to-treat$ setting: the intention is to give a random group of users the \"treatment\" (access to the easier sign-up process), but not all users will actually take it."
